# Week 1

## Day 1

* Used JavaScript syntax within TypeScript for familiarity.
* Declared and assigned variables using let, observing TypeScript's static typing system.
* Explored primitive data types such as string, number, and boolean.
* Introduced any type for variables that can hold any data type, disabling type checking.
* Discussed unknown type as a safer alternative to any.
* Learned about union types (|) to handle variables that can hold multiple types.
* Experienced type narrowing, where TypeScript infers more specific types based on code context.
